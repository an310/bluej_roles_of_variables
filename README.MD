### BlueJ IDE opt-in software tool extension 'roles of variables' updated (Sajaniemi, 2006) version

#### AUTHORS: Andreas Nikolakopoulos

The purpose of this project was twofold:  

☑ To upgrade the tool’s outdated list of data entities roles with the updated version of Sajaniemi (2006), analogously to the exhortations of (Sajaniemi et al. [2006b, pp.274-275]; Heikkilä [2008, pp.4-13]); i.e., removing the 'transformation' and adding the 'walker' and the 'container' data entities' roles.

☑ To integrate a supporting statement (a reason) in the cases where the role was unrecognized/unspecified by the tool, and the user was simply displayed with a probable suggested  role for the variable in question; again, taking into account Bishop’s counsel:  
"The mutual exclusivity of the rule sets means that where the role is not recognized, or unspecified …, the program is able to suggest a probable role for the variable in question,  *though at present it does not identify a supporting statement, or provide a reason for that suggestion*" (Bishop, 2005, p.22, my italics).
